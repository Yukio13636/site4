    <h2>‘We fought until the end’: French World Cup fans sing Les Bleus</h2>
    <p>“Les Bleus made us dream,” President Emmanuel Macron said after France’s dramatic World Cup final loss to Argentina.</p>

    <div class="pbox"><p class="paragrah">In Paris, forlorn fans trudged along Champs-Elysees avenue in the chilly night air, where the mood was reflected in the grey winter skies that blanketed the capital city.
    </br></br>
        “We’re disappointed, especially with a finish on penalties,” Louane, 14, who had travelled to Paris from the central Jura region to watch the game with his parents.
    </br></br> 
    Just once has a team ever come back from two goals down in the World Cup final, and that was West Germany’s 3-2 win over Hungary in 1954, which remains the only time a team has overcome such a deficit in the tournament final.
</br></br>  
    France fans will take solace though in the awe-inspiring performance by Mbappe, who slid past Lionel Messi to earn the well-deserved Golden Boot trophy on Sunday as the World Cup’s top player. He netted eight goals over the course of the 2022 tournament.
    </p></div>

    <div class="pbox"><p class="paragrah">“To come back from a two-goal deficit is incredible,” said Romain Balthazar, a 22-year-old engineering student who visited Paris with friends to watch the final. “We came to experience this on the Champs — it’s fabulous.”
    </br></br>
        French President Emmanuel Macron, who had travelled to Doha for the second time in a week to support Les Bleus, said he, too, was “very sad and disappointed”.
        
        Macron had consoled and addressed the distraught team in the locker room after the game.
    </br></br>
        Disturbances were reported in Paris as dejected fans clashed with some of the approximately 14,000 riot police deployed across the country for the final. Minor skirmishes were also reported last week when police fired tear gas in the aftermath of France’s semifinal win over Morocco.
